Solution:

We have a Composite primary key in Design A which is too long and could cause potential data entry and degrade database performance so in this
scenario we can go for surrogate key which is implemented in Design B. But due to non identifying relationship there might be some data integrity
issues, to overcome these issues we have to make sure that we are making the key attributes mandatory(enrollment ID,course ID, Student ID, Term ID).
We have to setup Referential integrity for original key attribute(the Attributes of surrogate key), we have to see the combination of original key 
attributes are unique,by using index for key attributes we can enforce this.
